# Request Logging Middleware

## Description
This project demonstrates how to create a Node.js application using Express with custom middleware functions for request logging. The middleware captures essential details such as the request method, URL, IP address, timestamps, and user-agent, providing insights into application traffic and client behavior.

## Features
- **Custom Middleware**: Logs detailed request information including method, URL, IP, and user-agent.
- **Logging Levels**: Supports various logging levels (`info` and `debug`) for enhanced visibility.
- **Global Middleware**: Automatically logs all incoming requests.
- **User-Agent Logging**: Captures client-specific details for debugging purposes.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **Morgan** (optional for advanced logging)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Atif-Mustafa/Request_Logging_Middleware.git
